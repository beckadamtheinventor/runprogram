# Usage
Copy the `asm` folder and `runprogram.h` into your project's `src` directory then `include "runprogram.h"` in your program.


# License
It's one routine, what else would I license it under? It's WTFPL. Use it for whatever.

# About
Made this routine so people can stop bugging the toolchain devs to implement it.
Also to stop clogging the Cemetech forums with people trying to do it themselves.
